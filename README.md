# VarcharImplementation
Program in C to implement the varchar datatype of DBMS in C. Array tends to waste the size allocated. Varchar dynamically allocates the size, thus preventing wastage of space.
The repository consists of a header file(similar to stdio, conio etc) which is imported in the main C file.
